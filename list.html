    <h2>know more :</h2>
    <p>Charity is defined as giving resources like time and money without expecting anything in return. This selfless giving serves the most vulnerable in society and helps ensure that peoples’ human rights and needs are met. Organizations built on this belief are nonprofits, which means they don’t benefit financially from donations intended for the causes they serve</p>
    <p>When people come together, they can make a big impact. Charities depend on individuals who commit to giving small amounts. While donations from big groups are great, a community that cares about a charity and who they serve is essential. It’s those small donations that add up. The power of community proves that when people care and come together, change is more than possible</p>
    <p>Gender inequality remains one of the world’s biggest problems. While progress has been made in many places, it’s estimated that it will take around a century for gender equality to be realized. Many charities tackle this issue directly and focus on the needs of women and girls. Education access, better job opportunities, and healthcare services all contribute to closing the world’s gender gap.</p>
